Summary:
The uppercase characters are not counted as vowels or consonants

Description:
When the user attempts to add a string with uppercase letters, they will not be counted as vowels or consonants.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Call the application with uppercase and lowercase chars

Bug:
The app will count only the lowercase letters

Expected results:
The application should count both, lower and uppercase letters.

---------------------------------

Summary:
The result is not in the order the strings are entered

Description:
When multiple strings are entered (eg. "first", "second", "third") the result is not always returned in the same order.
According to java doc (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html): it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time.
LinkedHashMap should solve this issue: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html

Steps to reproduce:
Note! You might need to rerun multiple times in order to catch the issue, as the HashMap might give the correct order as well.
1. Call the application with input: "first", "second", "third"
2. Check the order of the output

Bug:
The order received is not the same as the order entered.

Expected results:
According to the acceptance criteria:
I should see the number of vowels and consonant for each string in the order they are keyed in.

---------------------------------

Summary:
Entering 4 strings at once will provide no result

Description:
Entering 4 strings at once will result in no counting of vowels and consonants.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Call the application with input: "first", "second", "third", "forth"
2. Check for the output

Bug:
The application offers no output for the 4 strings.

Expected results:
According to the acceptance criteria:
I should be able to add up to 4 strings at once.
